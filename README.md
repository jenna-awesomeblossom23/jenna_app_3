# [Jenna's silly little website :)]
[This website is intended to walk the user through a series of pages in which they can choose to enter numbers and perform differnt operations on them or choose other special buttons that display smiley faces or frowny faces based on their input or a joke. Upon arriving on the home page, the user can click the "get started" button. They will then be prompted to enter 2 different numbers and are presented with five different buttons, an addition, multiplication, and exponent button as well as a special button and joke button. If the user selects any of the three mathematical operations, they will receive a message saying "you just ran a ___ function!". On the next page they can press the cat button for their final results or return to the home page. For the Special Button, the user will be directed to a page that displays a quantity of smiley and frowny faces based on the numbers they intitially entered. Additonally, when pressed, the joke button will display a funny joke about a magic dog. At the end of all these pages, the user will have the option to return to the home page. ]
